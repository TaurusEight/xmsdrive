  An Extended Memory (XMS) RAM drive developed for use with MS-DOS and
  FreeDOS.  The drive parameters allow use of either 16 or 12 bit FAT
  tables with sectors of either 128, 256 or 512 bytes.


Tools
-------

  ‘Xmsdrive’ was written using WASM, a freeware assembler written by
  Eric Tauck.  It can found at:

    ftp://ftp.sac.sk/sac/utilprog/wasm223.zip
    ftp://ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/utilprog/wasm223.zip


Use
-----

  Add a DEVICE line to the system’s ‘config.sys’ file.

  There are three parameters, the first is the size of the drive in
  K-bytes, the second parameter is the size of the drive sectors and
  the third parameters is the number of entries in the root directory.
  The last parameter is optional.

  For example:

    DEVICE=C:\xmsdrive.sys 64 128
